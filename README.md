## DIU-Result-Generator

### Before you go ahead read this
The app is dead that's the first thing you should know.

It's real [dead](https://github.com/mehedi-shafi/DIU-Result-Generator/wiki#death) now. I was getting (actually scrapping data from vus.daffodilvarsity.edu.bd) which is dead. And thus this is dead and I think will remain dead.

**I have no connection or whatsoever to authority for getting data from database.** and the google reCaptcha v2.0+ is not bypassable (as of now). Therefore this app cannot get you data from [student portal](http://studentportal.diu.edu.bd/#/result) by scrapping. 

However if you find any access to database you can use this as a skeleton app. Maybe let me know!! And make a pull request if you want my repo to have the latest update. 


This is the Android implementation for https://github.com/mehedi-shafi/DIU-Result-Sheet this project. Look into the README there. And WIKI as well for how things work.
